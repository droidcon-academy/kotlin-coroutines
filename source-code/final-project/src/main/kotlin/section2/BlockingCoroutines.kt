/**
 * Shows that `runBlocking` can be nested but blocks the thread each time.
 *
 * Execution order:
 * 1. The `main` function starts a `runBlocking` coroutine scope, blocking the main thread.
 * 2. Inside `main`â€™s `runBlocking`, another nested `runBlocking` is called.
 * 3. The inner `runBlocking` logs its start, delays for 2 seconds, computes a simple sum, then logs the result.
 * 4. After the inner `runBlocking` completes, control returns to the outer `runBlocking`.
 * 5. Finally, the program logs completion and terminates.
